# Progress Log

## Current Version
### Implementations
- Base project structure with Serverless Framework
- Three main endpoints for ranking queries
- Processing state logging system
- Timeout configuration for long operations
- Complete project documentation

### Next Steps
- Implement cache for frequent queries
- Add automated tests
- Improve performance monitoring
- Implement rate limiting
- Add authentication documentation

## Technical Decision History
1. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Decision: Use AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework
   - Reason: Automatic scalability and cost-effectiveness
   - Date: [Decision date]

2. **600s Timeout**
   - Decision: Configure long timeout for ranking operations
   - Reason: Processing multiple bubbles can be time-consuming
   - Date: [Decision date]

3. **Folder Structure**
   - Decision: Organize into domain, infrastructure, and utils
   - Reason: Clear separation of responsibilities
   - Date: [Decision date]

## Pending Improvements
### High Priority
- [ ] Implement Redis cache for frequent queries
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Implement per-user rate limiting
- [ ] Improve error logging
- [ ] Add performance metrics

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize MongoDB queries
- [ ] Implement endpoint pagination
- [ ] Add authentication documentation
- [ ] Improve error handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add deployment documentation
- [ ] Implement health check
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Improve troubleshooting documentation

## Known Issues
1. **Performance in Large Rankings**
   - Description: Operations with many pools can be slow
   - Impact: High
   - Proposed Solution: Implement cache and optimize queries

2. **Lack of Automated Tests**
   - Description: Insufficient test coverage
   - Impact: Medium
   - Proposed Solution: Implement test suite
